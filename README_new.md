# CS 167 Project 2: 


## Learning Objectives: üìù
For this project, you will be fine-tuning pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fine-grained categorization of bird species. As a machine learning tool, you will be using the PyTorch and sklearn libraries to conduct a machine learning experiment, and your write-up will ask you to explain what you did and interpret the results. This directly addresses two of the course learning objectives stated in the syllabus:
- Students will be able to create software which utilizes machine learning programming libraries in order to conduct machine-learning-based data analysis.
- Students will be able to develop and conduct machine-learning-based data analysis experiments, and they will be able to interpret and explain the results.

## Project Description: üé• üçø
For this project, you should use this [_Bird Species dataset_](https://analytics.drake.edu/~reza/teaching/cs167_fall23/dataset/bird_species_v1.zip). This dataset can also be found on Blackboard for CS167. While in class, we focused on basic-level categorization, such as binary classification of dogs vs. cats or multi-class classification of bikes, cats, dogs, and persons. In this project, our interest lies in a more fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) of a biological domain ie, _birds_. This field has a well-studied taxonomy and offers valuable ecological applications. You will be using the given _Bird Species dataset_ to learn a deep neural network model so that it can predict the specific species of a bird when given any future image. Imagine how cool it would be if you can deploy this model to an iPhone or an Android app that people around the world can use while hiking or exploring amazon rainforest.

## Project Expectations: ‚òëÔ∏è
**New**: At the very top of your notebook, I'm asking that in a text cell, you **describe how many points you attempted to get from this project**. Tell me what you think you deserve on this notebook given the rubric at the bottom of this page. 

You will create a Colab notebook that includes your code and results to document your experiment. Most importantly, you will use text cells in the notebook to explain what you did, interpret the results, and make your recommendations. The written markdown protions must include the following things:
1. **Problem** [1 point]: State the problem you are trying to solve with this machine learning experiment. Include a description of the data, and what you're trying to predict. What are the possible uses for this kind of machine learning model?
2. **Explore the Data** [5 points]: Find the values for the following metrics: 
    - __Number of Samples__: total number of examples you have in the data 
    - __Number of classes__: total number of topics or categories in the data
    - __Number of words per sample__: Median number of words in one sample
    - __Distribution of sample length__: Distribution showing the number of words per sample in the dataset (use the function `hist()` on a list that has the lenght of each row). 
    - __Something Else__: Show me something else about the data--your choice.
3.  **Data Preparation** [1 point]: Explain your data preparation. What did you have to do to get your data in shape for your experiments - word embeddings, stop words, vectorization, tokeniztion, etc. 
4.  **Metrics** [1 point]: What metrics will you use to evaluate your model? Why are these metrics the best for your model? (Hint, this should be more than 'accuracy').
5.  **Model Planning and Execution** [1 point]: Identify which learning algorithms you will try and which important parameters you will tune for each one. 
6.  **Bumps in the Road** [1 point]: What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome these challenges? Did you have to adapt your strategy to account for these challenges? Why or why not?
7.  **Results** [1 point]: After you conduct your learning experiment, summarize the results you got. Include visualizations as appropriate. 
8.  **Conclusions**: What insights/recommendations do you have? What did you find that was interesting? Which model was your best model, which models didn't work well? Why do you think this is? In general, I want a discussion of your experiment, the results, and what they mean.

### Your Experiments Should Demonstrate the following Machine Leanring Techniques:
From Scikit-Learn:
- **Support Vector Classifer**
- **Principal Component Analysis**
- **Perceptron**
- **MLP**

üìâ üìä üìà üíπ You also should include at least **4 visualizations (graphs)** of tuning parameters.

## Extra Credit ‚ú®
As promised, you will have an opportunity to earn extra credit on this project. You will be able to earn up to 2 points of extra credit by using the IMDB database to build a **word-level** language model that is able to generate text (much like we did in [Day 23's Notes](https://github.com/merriekay/CS167Code/blob/main/Day23Notes_RNNs4NLP.ipynb). Build your model, train it, evaluate it, and then demonstrate that you are able to use it to generate new movie reviews.
